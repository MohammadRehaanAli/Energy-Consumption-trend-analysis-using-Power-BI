# Energy-Consumption-trend-analysis-using-Power-BI
This project focuses on analyzing energy consumption data from 2016 to 2020 to uncover trends, seasonal patterns, and anomalies. I performed extensive data cleaning and transformation, ensuring accuracy by merging datasets, handling missing values, and standardizing formats.

Using Power BI, I created interactive dashboards to visualize energy costs, city-wise consumption, and usage trends across electricity, gas, and water. Key visualizations included line charts, bar graphs, and pie charts to showcase patterns and insights effectively.

The analysis revealed actionable insights, such as identifying high-cost cities and seasonal spikes, which informed recommendations for optimizing energy usage and reducing costs. This project demonstrates skills in data preparation, visualization, and storytelling with data
